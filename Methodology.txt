[X]General // beginning 
    [X]Install all dependencies
    [X]Source bootstrap and jQuery into project and HTML
    [X]File structure it up!
    [X]HTML Outline
    [X]Setup PORT


[] Base Goals
    [] Make a calculator in the server with a U.I.
        on client-side
            [X] 2 number inputs
            [X] =, -, /, *, +, selector for type of math
            [X] Clear button to empty user Input
                [X] Clear should remove result as well
            [X] When the submit (= button) is clicked, capture this input,
                bundle it up in an object, and send this object to the server
                via a POST. 
                [] Server-side math for the inputs
            [X] do not use eval() for this assignment
            [] History of past calculations on DOM
            [] Save history, put it on DOM


Making the calculation work
    [X]Client-side
        [X]Take inputs, make them an object
        [X]Send said object to server
        [X]Take response and put it on the DOM
        [X]To put on DOM - send to a function that adds specifically that eq.
        [X]History on DOM - get the history from server
        [X]Iterate over history and put it on the DOM
    []Server-side
        []Receive Inputs
        []Math(???)
        []add a result to the object
        []Add the object to history
        []Return the object with result

[] Stretch Goals
    []Replace inputs with 1-0 buttons
    []POST only happen if all input is ready bootstrap checkbox input?
    []Clear history button
    []Allow re-running math from history by clicking it
